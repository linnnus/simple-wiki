My Simple wiki system
=====================

This project is an attempt to make the simplest wiki possible. It uses a proper
version control system to avoid the inner platform effect [1] and it does
simple, stateless rendering of a basic markup language [3].

The hope is that this simplicity leads to composability and extensibility. In a
way, these files represent my effort to understand and fully appreaciate The
Unix Philosophyâ„¢ [2].
