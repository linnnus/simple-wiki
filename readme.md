My Simple wiki system
=====================

This project is an attempt to make the simplest wiki possible. It uses a proper
version control system to avoid [the inner platform effect][inner-platform] and it does
simple, stateless rendering of a basic markup language, [Wiki creole][creole].

The hope is that this simplicity leads to composability and extensibility. In a
way, these files represent my effort to understand and fully appreaciate [The
Unix Philosophyâ„¢][unix-philosophy].
